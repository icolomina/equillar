## Disclaimer and Legal Notice
This project is provided as a technical foundation and educational purposes only. It provides a base implementation for allowing companies to register investment projects and for investors to connect their wallets and make capital contributions using stablecoins on the Stellar network, with balances and payments managed by smart contracts deployed on Soroban.

The project is actively maintained and will continue to evolve: new features, improvements, and integrations may be added over time to increase technical value for developers, integrators, and companies that adopt it. Such ongoing development aims to expand functionality and improve usability, security, and interoperability, but does not alter the legal disclaimers, warranties, or responsibilities described in this document.
