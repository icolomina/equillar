# Equillar

Equillar is an open-source fintech application that enables companies and institutions to publish projects seeking funding, and allows investors to contribute capital using stablecoins issued on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) blockchain using [Soroban](https://stellar.org/soroban) contracts. 
This application deploy the contracts on the [Soroban testnet](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/deploy-to-testnet) and those contrats manage balances, payments and returns.

Equillar is not offered as a deployed SaaS service. It provides a technology stack that organizations and developers can use as the foundation for their own applications.
